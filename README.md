## shinyhydat

[![img](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle-Experimental-339999)](https://github.com/bcgov/repomountie/blob/master/doc/lifecycle-badges.md)

This is a shiny app to view and download historical streamflow data from
a downloaded HYDAT SQLite database and real-time data using
[tidyhydat](https://github.com/ropensci/tidyhydat).

## Setup

These instructions assume that you have [installed R and
RStudio](https://github.com/bcgov/bcgov-data-science-resources/wiki/Installing-R-&-RStudio)
already on your computer.

### Package downloads

The first step to getting the shinyhydat up and running on your machine
is to download all the packages needed by the shiny app. All of these
packages are available on CRAN with the exception of `tidyhydat`. Type
the following into R console to install all of them:

``` r
install.packages("tidyhydat")
install.packages("shinydashboard")
install.packages("leaflet")
install.packages("plotly")
install.packages("devtools")
install.packages("shinyWidgets")
install.packages("shiny")
```

### HYDAT download

The second step to using the shinyhydat is to download a version of the
HYDAT database, Environment and Climate Change Canadaâ€™s comprehensive
database of historical hydrometric data. The `tidyhydat` package
provides a convenience function to download HYDAT (be patient though
this takes a long time\!):

``` r
tidyhydat::download_hydat()
```

tidyhydat functions will automatically know where to look for HYDAT if
you download HYDAT using this function.

## Usage

  - Open app.R file in RStudio and run the app.
